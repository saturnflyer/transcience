# Clone of [Avdi's Decoration Post](http://devblog.avdi.org/2012/01/31/decoration-is-best-except-when-it-isnt/)

This is a clone of the first half or so of Avdi's post, just to assert
for myself that these issues are real.

There are [tests asserting his examples](test_character.rb), and the last one fails,
representing the delegator strategy failing our real-world intuitions.
